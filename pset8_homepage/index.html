                Hello, world! I'm Arjun. Welcome to my website!
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a freshman at UC Davis studying computer science. This is my first [formal] dive into programming a website,
                so please have some patience with navigating this website. I've usually stuck to backend development and machine learning, but this is
                a new and exciting challenge--and one I have to take on for CS50x :)--and I hope to get better at front-end a web development as I progress
                in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this website, you'll find the history of my journey in computer science thus far. Have fun poking around :)
            </p>

        <!-- Interests & Future Plans -->
        <div id="future_plans">
            <h3 class="display-3">Interests & Future Plans</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                I have big plans for the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've always felt the need to learn, but not necessarily because it's fun. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time exploring
                what different concentrations, languages, classes, and people computer science has to offer. But it goes deeper than that. I have a fear
                of black holes, but more of what they represent: the edge between the known and unknown. We can only predict, but not yet know what's beyond
                the mysterious event horizon, and that blank void that stares back at me frightens me. I'm scared of the unknown, and I comfort that fear by
                learning as much as I can. It's a toxic relationship I share with learning, but it's one that makes me certain my future pursuits will end
                the same way regardless of which path I choose: success.
            </p>

            <p>
                All that being said, I do hope to dive deeper into machine learning and what it has to offer the world, but also what it has to harm the world.
