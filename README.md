# Harvard-CS50X #
This repository contains all the work I submitted for the Harvard CS 50X course on EdX. These files are for **reference ONLY**. Please do not copy and use my code (a) without citation and (b) in place of your own. In other words, any work I publish should be used to inspire your own code, not as an answer key. Especially since my code is not perfect.

Please note the stylistic change a few weeks into the course: I had taken a break from the course to focus on college coursework and developed a different coding style.
